## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

### Deposit Security:
1. **Blockchain Verification**: Every deposit is verified on the blockchain
2. **Amount Validation**: Ensures exact amount matches
3. **Address Verification**: Confirms funds went to system addresses
4. **Manual Override**: Admins can manually verify when needed

### Withdrawal Security:
1. **Address Validation**: Validates wallet addresses before processing
2. **Balance Verification**: Ensures sufficient funds
3. **Suspicious Activity Detection**: Flags unusual patterns
4. **Limit Enforcement**: Prevents excessive withdrawals

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### Admin Dashboard Features:
- **Pending Deposits Count**: Real-time count of pending verifications
- **Pending Withdrawals Count**: Real-time count of pending withdrawals
- **Monthly Statistics**: 30-day deposit and withdrawal totals
- **Recent Activity**: Latest transactions requiring attention
- **Verification Logs**: Complete audit trail

### User Features:
- **Deposit Verification**: Users can verify their own deposits
- **Withdrawal Statistics**: Users can view their withdrawal history
- **Transaction Status**: Real-time status updates

## üîÑ Workflow Examples

### Deposit Workflow:
1. User creates deposit record with transaction hash
2. System verifies transaction on blockchain
3. Confirms amount and recipient address
4. Updates deposit status to CONFIRMED
5. Credits user's wallet balance
6. Processes referral bonuses (if applicable)

### Withdrawal Workflow:
1. User requests withdrawal with wallet address
2. System validates address format and existence
3. Checks user's balance and withdrawal limits
4. Detects suspicious activity patterns
5. Admin reviews and approves/rejects
6. Processes withdrawal and deducts from balance

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Environment Setup:
```bash
# Add these environment variables to your .env file
BSCSCAN_API_KEY=your_bscscan_api_key
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key
POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY=your_polygonscan_api_key
